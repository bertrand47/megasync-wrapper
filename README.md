megasync-wrapper
================
This wrapper replaces the inconsistent (and awful) MEGAsync tray icon with an elementary-styled monochrome icon.

Usage
==============
To install, simply run `bash install.sh`

Note
==============
In case you've enabled the "Start on startup" option in the MEGAsync settings GUI after running the install script, run it again to apply the changes.
