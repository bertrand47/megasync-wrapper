#megasync-wrapper
This wrapper replaces the inconsistent (and awful) MEGAsync tray icon with an elementary-styled monochrome icon.

#Usage

    cd
    git clone https://github.com/cybre/megasync-wrapper.git
    cd megasync-wrapper
    bash install.sh

#Note
In case you've enabled the "Start on startup" option in the MEGAsync settings GUI after running the install script, run it again to apply the changes.

This wrapper is based on an older version of "skype-wrapper".
